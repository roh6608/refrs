//To-do
//- character double pointer of all the possible entry types
//- structs for each of the entry types
//- use fopen and fprintf to write to the file
//- use scanf to read strings in for each of them
//-make efficient both in a usage sense and a coding sense try and reduce the amount of re-writing similar stuff
// so prototype properly etc. encapsulate in functions, possible use header file for the data structure sort of things
// - make the program easily extensible
// - take command line flags and file name as arguments in the main function, then have a parser or something for the 
// options so that mroe options can be added easily.
